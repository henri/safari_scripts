Note
=====
This is very old. I have not tested in over 13 years. If it works, please let me know. Use at your own risk!


Usage
=====

Run "save_urls.app" to save the URLs from Safari. This overwrites previously saved url's.

Run "restore_urls.app" to open saved URLs to Safari.

Run "archive_saved_urls.app" to copy the currently saved URLs to a dated text file within the "archives" directory.

Run "search_windows.app" to search the currently opened window titles for specific text. This is handy if you have a lot of windows/tabs open.


Additional Information
======================

Also, a very handy extension if you are using Safari is called Sessions (by David Yoo) :
